[["index.html", "US Museums and Libraries Analysis Chapter 1 Introduction", " US Museums and Libraries Analysis Group 5: Yuanyi Hu, Yining Ma, Yi Zhuang 2022-12-15 Chapter 1 Introduction In old days, people would like to visit the museums or the public libraries in their spare time for relaxation or looking for new information. Thus, there are libraries and museums across the nation aimed to serving people live in the region. Additionally, there are famous paintings, sculptures and other art works created by talented artist from all over the world preserving in some of museums in the country which becomes one of the must-visit scenic spots for travelers as well as the locals. As a result, libraries and museums are important components in the culture of a country and people’s life which makes it necessary and interesting to look into the data related to them. There are different kinds of museums such as museum of arts or museum for children and some museums are free to visit while some charging a ticket. For the public libraries, there are libraries with different scale and some provide more than just printed books. We are interested in the distribution of museums and libraries across the country including what kinds of museum are there and how many of museums or libraries across the country or in different states. Also, as both of them are part of the nation’s culture development, we are also curious about whether their distribution across the country has some similarity or clustering pattern. Moreover, with the development of technology, especially the use of cellphone and laptop which provides people a easy way to get new information, many people tend search on the internet when they are curious or eager to know something and people can read ebook on their cellphone or see the photo of the famous artworks instead of going to a library or museum for entertainment. We are also interested in how many people visit museum or library in their spare time in the new century. To sum up, we choose the topic about the museums and public libraries in US and would like to analyze the related data to explore in this topic. "],["proposal.html", "Chapter 2 Proposal 2.1 Research topic 2.2 Data availability", " Chapter 2 Proposal 2.1 Research topic Our research topic is about the museums and public libraries across the US. For the museums, there are different kinds of museums including art museums, history museums and so on. We are interested in the number of different kinds of museums countrywide and statewide. Also, different states have different number of museums which partly reflect the culture and development of individual states. Some of the museums are free to visit while some need to buy ticket, thus we would like to further analyze the income of individual museums. For the libraries, some libraries provide readers more than printed materials, such as audio and e-books and analyzing the number of books and other resources of a library can reflect the scale of the library. As many of libraries were built especially for the local resident and we would like to analyze relationship between the number of people visit the library or register in the library and the population of that area. Some of the libraries have librarian and we are also interested in their salary and also other aspect related to the economic condition of the library including their revenue. Also, to analyze the influence of modern technology, we would like to analyze the trend of the number of visitors of libraries. Moreover, as both the construction of museums and libraries are part of the culture development of a region, we will put data of libraries and museums together and explore whether there are some similarities between public libraries and museums in the same region which can reflect how much importance local government put on the culture development. In a word, our research focus on the number of museums and libraries across the nation as well as their scale and operation condition. By analyzing the distribution of the museums and libraries in different region, we try to analyze the local culture development. 2.2 Data availability The data used in this project are from the official website of the Institute of Museum and Library Services(IMLS): https://www.imls.gov/research-tools/data-collection . It contains information about location, discipline, revenues, etc. All datasets are in .csv format, which simplifies the data import process. The museum data are consisted of three datasets, and can be downloaded by link: https://www.imls.gov/sites/default/files/2018_csv_museum_data_files.zip . According to the Data File Documentation and User’s Guide for museum data on the website, the first release of these files is from 2013 to 2015 (FY 2014 Q1, FY 2015 Q1 and FY 2015 Q3, where “FY” stands for “Fiscal Year”, and “Q” stands for “Quarter”). The final cleaning and construction are from 2017-2018, which gives the newest (current) data version. Researchers of IMLS collected the data from multiple sources, for example, IMLS administrative records and lists of grantees from private foundations. The duplicate data during the collecting process were removed by combining statistical algorithms and manual entry review, guaranteeing data reliability. Each of the three files has the same data structure: one row per museum or related organization, with 50 column variables. During data import process, we will select the variables which are related to our research topic. For example, we can explore the distribution of museum over different locations by comparing AAMREG, BEAREG, LOCALE4 (geographical variables) with Museum Discipline. Then, we can obtain information about the number of museums in each state and the distribution of museum types among different states. We can also explore the relationship between museum income and types by comparing INCOMECD15 and Museum Discipline. The library data has been collected annually since 1988, but the electronic records are from 1992 to 2020. We will first use the most recent three datasets released in 2020: https://www.imls.gov/sites/default/files/2022-07/pls_fy2020_csv.zip . The data are collected using public libraries survey by recording the time, location, citizen satisfaction with library service, etc. To be more specific, surveys are distributed by data coordinators in each state, and then collected back from local public libraries. During the data import process, we will select the variables which demonstrate the number of visitors, amount of books, and revenue, of local libraries and then analyze the relationship between them. We will also analyze the development of libraries over time by using the relevant data from different years. To compare the similarity or differences between public libraries and museums in the same region, we will use these two datasets: https://www.imls.gov/sites/default/files/pnlms_pudf_csv.zip, which demonstrate the public needs for libraries and museums. The data were collected through a random-digit dialing telephone survey, which includes visitation to libraries and museums, attitudes toward library and museum services, and demographics. During the data import process, we will select the variables with the same geographical information as the above datasets because we want to compare the development of public libraries and museums in the same area by combining them with the previous datasets. Hence, these datasets provide sufficient information to analyze our research topic. "],["data.html", "Chapter 3 Data 3.1 Sources 3.2 Cleaning / transformation 3.3 Missing value analysis", " Chapter 3 Data 3.1 Sources 3.1.1 Museum Data Source The Museum data is from the official website of the Institute of Museum and Library Services(IMLS), and we use the latest version that collected in 2018. There are three csv files that contain different type of museums. The second file just contains GMU museums, the third file just contains HSC museums. The three files contain 7431, 7961, 14786 museums, and each file has 58 variables, including some basic information, like the id, location, contact, ruledate information, and the income and revenue information. And we choose to mainly analyse the state, discipline, income and the established dates, therefore, we select the relevant columns to conduct our analysis. The discipline contains 9 values, reflecting 9 kinds of museums; we choose IncomeCD15 to present museum income, which 9 ranges of income from 0 to 50,000,000 and greater; rule_date the registered nonprofit organization was recognized as having obtained their formal tax-exempt status by the IRS, we use this column to present the established date. 3.1.2 Library Data Source The library data set is also from https://www.imls.gov/ which is the website of the Institute of Museum and Library Service. This institute provide several data set regarding museum and library across the nation. We use the data set of The Public Libraries Survey (PLS) which supplied annually by public libraries across the country on when, where, and how library services are changing to meet the needs of the public. The data was collected by the institute. The survey is administered by Data Coordinators and the requested data was collected from local public libraries. There is a web-based reporting system State Data Coordinators used report data to the institute. The survey was conducted annually since 1988 and the website provides data files since 1992. During past years, the content on the survey changed 3 times and the format of the data sets are slightly differences. As for the data file, the data files are available on the web site and is a public-used data set which means some of the data was removed aimed to protect the confidentiality of individually identifiable survey respondents. Our project use this public-used data set which was encoded and pre-processed and provides a documentation file to help the user correctly understand the data set and gives detailed information about the data set. The data set provides statistics on the status of public libraries in the United States collected from approximately 9,000 public libraries with approximately 17,000 individual public library outlets in the 50 states, the District of Columbia, and outlying territories. The data set contains information about library visits, circulation, size of collections, public service hours, staffing, electronic resources, operating revenues and expenditures and number of service outlets. We basically use the state wide data which contains 55 rows and more than 100 variables. 3.2 Cleaning / transformation 3.2.1 Museum Data Cleaning We firstly select the columns that we need from three files and then modify the data type of ID from string to numeric to match each other and then merge them together. Then we created different data frames group by state, discipline, income, and decades of the rule date to further show the distribution of museums in different disciplines and states, the relationships between variables, and the museum growth trends from 1900s to 2010s. 3.2.2 Library Data Cleaning The data format in the library data set is quite clean and suitable for us to use. Thus, we didn’t do much on cleaning them but only went through the variables in the data set and select the variables that we are interested in. The state data in the data set is coded. As a result, we used another data set which contains the name of state and the code of state and combine them to get the state name we need. 3.3 Missing value analysis 3.3.1 Museum Data ## MID DISCIPLINE ADSTATE INCOMECD15 RULEDATE15 ## 3 0 0 8677 8682 There is no missing data in discipline and state, but are 8677(28.8%) empty value in incomecd, and 8682(28.8%) empty value in rule date. Most missing cases are missing rule date and incomecd together, which means missing these two variables are correlated. If MID is missing, we think it is not a valid museum record, and will delete this record. The overall situation for missing data is reasonable since we can restore the shape of the map of the USA by plotting the rest of the data according to each pair of the location variable. 3.3.2 Library Data We first visualize the missing data in our data set and discuss the pattern it has. This is an important step for us to under stand our data. #### Library Data Set 1. Library data of 2020 In this project, we first analyze the data of Library in US in 2020. According to the document of the data set, all the missing data is filled with ‘-1’. Thus, we will visualize the distribution of ‘-1’ in this data set. As we can see from the graph, the only row has missing data is the state with code ‘VI’ which is Virgin Islands. All other data is completed. As this state is an outlying area of the United States and missing data are primarily some statistic data about the revenue and resource data of the library, we believe it is reasonable to keep the data as ‘-1’ in these rows which have little effect on our visualization. This graph shows the pattern further which is most rows (data of different state) is complete and provide us a relatively good data quality to analyze and visualize the libraries in US. 3.3.2.1 Time series missing data analysis Moreover, to discuss the changing pattern of libraries in US, we collect library data in different years. Although we can easily read in all the raw data, band them together and select the variables we are interested in, we believe that to store such a large set of data makes the requirement of space of this project too big and the transforming progress takes a lot of time. As a result, we choose the variable in each years’ data and store them in a csv file. As the data update once a year, it will not take too much time to add new data to this file. As for the data format, we keep it same with the original data and all the missing data is filled with ‘-1’. As we can see from the graph, there are three states having missing data through the years which are GU(Guam), MP(Northern Mariana Islands) and VI(Virgin Islands). All of these states are outlying area of the United States. Thus, we keep these data with its original form. As we can see in this chart, among all the rows having missing data, some of them missing quite a lot of data while others only miss one or two data. As we result, we would like to further see the missing data. We select all the rows of the three states and data is as below: ## STABR YEAR POPU_LSA CENTLIB BRANLIB BKMOB BKVOL EBOOK VISITS ## 1 GU 2020 168678 1 5 0 286930 0 35115 ## 2 MP 2020 53883 1 2 1 83624 5500 44710 ## 3 VI 2020 106405 0 5 3 176762 -1 -1 ## 4 GU 2019 168678 1 5 0 278963 0 100095 ## 5 MP 2019 51433 1 2 1 82199 5000 147983 ## 6 VI 2019 106405 0 5 3 176762 -1 -1 ## 7 GU 2018 167358 1 5 0 276631 0 75119 ## 8 MP 2018 51994 1 2 1 92000 5000 126778 ## 9 VI 2018 106405 0 4 3 -1 -1 -1 ## 10 GU 2017 164229 1 5 0 272720 200 81572 ## 11 MP 2017 53883 1 2 0 92141 5000 104224 ## 12 GU 2016 159358 1 5 0 269270 200 71813 ## 13 GU 2015 159358 1 5 0 266695 200 72223 ## 14 GU 2014 159358 1 5 0 263486 1335 103593 ## 15 MP 2014 53883 1 1 0 -1 -1 -1 ## 16 VI 2014 106405 0 5 1 -1 -1 -1 ## 17 GU 2013 159358 1 5 1 260586 0 98969 ## 18 MP 2013 53883 1 1 0 -1 -1 -1 ## 19 VI 2013 106405 0 5 1 -1 -1 -1 ## 20 GU 2012 159358 1 5 1 258241 1278 75472 ## 21 MP 2012 53883 1 1 0 -1 -1 -1 ## 22 VI 2012 106405 0 5 1 -1 -1 -1 ## 23 GU 2011 159358 1 5 1 255277 0 80016 ## 24 MP 2011 53883 1 1 0 -1 -1 -1 ## 25 VI 2011 106405 0 5 1 -1 -1 -1 ## 26 GU 2010 180692 1 5 1 204503 0 84019 ## 27 MP 2010 53883 1 1 0 -1 -1 -1 ## 28 VI 2010 106405 0 5 1 -1 -1 -1 ## 29 GU 2009 175459 1 5 1 210079 0 60763 ## 30 MP 2009 -1 -1 -1 -1 -1 -1 -1 ## 31 VI 2009 -1 -1 -1 -1 -1 -1 -1 ## 32 GU 2008 25984 1 5 1 211772 -1 70061 ## 33 MP 2008 -1 -1 -1 -1 -1 -1 -1 ## 34 VI 2008 -1 -1 -1 -1 -1 -1 -1 ## 35 GU 2007 -1 -1 -1 -1 -1 -1 -1 ## 36 MP 2007 -1 -1 -1 -1 -1 -1 -1 ## 37 VI 2007 -1 -1 -1 -1 -1 -1 -1 ## 38 GU 2006 -1 -1 -1 -1 -1 -1 -1 ## 39 MP 2006 -1 -1 -1 -1 -1 -1 -1 ## 40 VI 2006 -1 -1 -1 -1 -1 -1 -1 From the table, we can see that in some year(2016,2015), two of the states didn’t report the data and among all the reported data, most of the missing data is in early years. As we would like to see the trend of the data, we also keep the original data in this data set in stead of filling them in some way. "],["results.html", "Chapter 4 Results 4.1 Museum in US 4.2 Library in US 4.3 Museum and Library in US", " Chapter 4 Results 4.1 Museum in US 4.1.1 Discipline museums distribution in states We can find that HSC(Historical Societies and Historic Preservation) and GMU(Uncategorized or General Museums) take great share in each state’s museums, especially HSC. And the proportions of different disciplines in different states remains similar, which means there is no obvious tendency of a state to own one kind of museum more than other kinds. 4.1.2 Relationship between income and Discipline It shows that there are a lot of museums did not provide their income status. In those museums that provided incomes, except ART and CMU, other discipline museums that did not have incomes take biggest share, especially HSC, since most of this kind of museum don’t need tickets. But since Art Museums are often charge highly, there are great proportion of Art museums earn income over 50,000,000 in 2015. And there are more CMU (children museum) earn between 25,000 and 4,999,999 than other incomes, which means most CMU need tickets and parents are willing to visit them to educate their kids. And for other kinds of museums, incomes between 25,000 and 4,999,999 also take some shares. 4.1.3 Relationship between Location and Revenue The sustainable development of museums can preserve local culture and history. However, it’s possible to face the situation that museums with certain themes are more popular than others, hence the considerable income for local governments. It’s essential to keep the balanced development for all categories instead of being profit-seeking. If the current development of the museum follows the local features, then the geographical location should be a dominant variable in terms of the distribution of the museum. First, we can look at the distribution of museum income levels among different states. We can see that there is no significant difference in the distribution in terms of states in each income level, which means that the income level should not have a strong relationship with the development of the local museums. However, we still need further evidence to support our hypothesis. To examine the relationship between location and revenue further, we can use principal component analysis on INCOME15, REVENUE15 (profit-related variables), LONGITUDE,LATITUDE (geographical variables). We can see that the vectors standing for the revenue and income are almost overlapping together, which means the data matched the collecting process as mentioned in the official guide: the income is calculated by using the revenue minus the operation cost in that year. Also, we can see that the distribution of museums follows the vectors of latitude and longitude closely, and the museum locations are not correlated with income and revenue since they are almost perpendicular to each other. Hence, the current development of museums is not profit-seeking since there is no relationship between location and revenue based on the above results. 4.1.4 New museums trend The numbers of most kinds of museums increase slowly since 1920s to 2000s. Since the data is collected in 2018, the new museum numbers cannot present the total 2010s. Before 2010s, there is an obvious increase of HSC from 1950s to 2000s, which indicates that the government established lots of Historical Societies/ Historic Preservation after 1950s. Besides that, the numbers of GMU and HST also increased a lot. The rapid growth of history related museum reflects that we care about history more and more in recent days. Also, the number of art museum in 1940s has an obvious increase, which means the fashion of enjoying art was prevailing at that time. 4.2 Library in US 4.2.1 Analysis of Library 2020 4.2.1.1 Population and visitors We first analyze the population, number of people visit local library and number of register member of library in each state. The cleveland dot plot is ordered by the population of each state. As we can see from the graph, there is a overall trend of the state has large population tend to have more visitor and register to libraries in the state. In another word, there is a positive correlation between the population and the number of visitors. However, this is not graranteed as there are some state with large population having relatively small number of visitors like Texas and Florida. 4.2.1.2 Number of library Then, we would like to analyze the number of library in each state. There are basically three kinds of libraries: center library, branch library and book mobile. We use a stacked bar chart to show the number of library in each state and the bars are ordered by the population of each state. As we can see, there is also a positive correlation between the population of each state and the number of library. However, this is not graranteed as there are some state with large population having relatively small number of library like Florida and Arizona. In the following part, we are interested in other aspect of different state’s libraries which is more closely related to the number of library instead of the population. To better analyze the patterns of these variables, we make a stacked bar chart of the number of library in each state ordered by the total number of library. As we can see from the graph above, the proportion of different kind of libraries are different among different states. For example, California has a large proportion of branch libraries while New York has more proportion of main libraries. This shows that the structure of library systems of different states are different. 4.2.1.3 Collections of Libraries There are several kinds of resource in each library: printed material, audio resource in physical format or digital format, video resource in physical format or digital format, ebook, state digital resource and other electronic resource. As the last two kinds are relatively small, we combine them together and set as a new group ‘other digital resource’. The stacked bar chart is sorted by the number of library in each state. As we can see, there is a positive correlation between the number of library and the total resource owned by local library. However, there are also many outliers like Ohio and Kansas which own much more resource than expected. Further more, we can see from the graph that different state’s library’s resource pattern are different. Some of the state has more proportion of electronic resource while some of the libraries have more proportion of printed material. 4.2.1.4 Events Hold by Libraries Most of the libraries hold reading event for readers. There are events for children, young adult and others. As we can see from the graph above, state with more number of library tend to have more reading event over state. Among all the events, most states’ library tend to have more program for children except New York and Florida. 4.2.1.5 Revenue As we all know that most of the libraries are free for residents to visit and a large proportion of money are from revenue. There are four kinds of revenue that a library can have, which are revenue from federal government, state government, local government and others. We ordered the stacked bar chart in the order of number of libraries in a state. As we can see from the graph, the relationship between the number of library and total amount of revenue is relatively weak comparing with other characters we analyzed before. This shows that some of the states’ library receive more revenue than others. Most of states’ library receive more revenue from their local government while there are several state receive more revenue from other way. We can also see that New York, Massachusetts and Hawaii’s libraries receive relatively large amount of revenue from the state government which some how reflect the importance put on libraries or other entertainment and culture by the state. 4.2.1.6 Overall Analysis We put all the variables we discussed together including the population, number of visitors, number of register, printed material resource, ebook resource, electronic resource, programs and revenue. We can see from the parallel coordinate graph that the relationship between each variable are basically positive correlated for most of the states and each variable has outliers. California is outlier for all the variables regarding the number of people including the number of visitor, member of library. New York has biggest volume of books while Kansas and Ohio has really high number of ebook and Pennsylvania has highest number of other electronic resource. California and New York receive highest amount of revenue. As we can see from above, some of the state dominate more than one variable like California and New York while more than half of states have relative low value in all of the variables which shows a inequality development of library in different state. As we can see from the spatial graph, the state with higher number of library are clustered on the east side of the country especially the north east region while the state in the west east have relatively low number of library. 4.2.2 Time Series Analysis We also interested in the change of data during past 15 years as the world changed quickly with the development of internet and all kinds of entertainment in people’s life. Thus, we make a series of graph to show the change in number of library, number of people visit library annually, and the number of books and ebooks in library. As our data is annual data, we didn’t transform it into ‘date’ data type but keep it as integer. 4.2.2.1 Population change in past 15 years First, we show that the population of each state has a slow but stable increasing trend during the past 15 years. Although the increment is not so big except several big state. The top five population dense states are California, Texas, Florida, New York and Pennsylvania. We didn’t show Florida and Pennsylvania in the graph with particular corresponding color as these two states don’t rank top in the other statistic value regarding library. 4.2.2.2 Number of Library change in past 15 years Then, we compare the number of library in each state and we can see that most of states’ number of library didn’t change during the past 15 years. 4.2.2.3 Number of people visit library After we known that the population didn’t decrease but indeed increased in most of states and the number of library didn’t change, we can see that the proportion of population decreased during the past 15 years. In other word, less people visit library during the past years which may partly due to people can search information more and more conveniently on cellphone or computer and have more ways to relax during their spare time. It is also very likely that people live better life now and they can afford buying their own copy of book instead of borrow one. However, comparing with the decrease in 2020, the decrease trend is much more subtle which means that there are still lots of people go to library before the pandemic. The covid-19 has more impact on whether people would like to or whether they can visit a library. 4.2.2.4 Printed material change during past 15 years Then, we can see that the collection of books in some state’s library has a decreasing trend during the past 15 years which is especially clear in some of the state has large volume of books in the past. This is quite surprising outcome as it seems unlikely that people in the library throw away books. 4.2.2.5 Number of ebook change during past 15 years On the contrary, we can see a quick increase in the collection of books in most of state’s library during the past 10 years. Ebook came out around 2010 and became more and more popular during the past years. There are several state ended with a really large number of collection of ebook which shows they put a lot of importance on this kind of resource provided to people. We can also specify that the state with relatively large collection of ebook are also those with large collection of printed materials which show that a state kind of support the development of library. 4.3 Museum and Library in US 4.3.1 Museum map It shows that California, Texas and New York states have obviously more museums than other states, the numbers are over 1600. There are more museums in the east than west, and more in the outside states than states in the middle. Especially, in Delaware, Alaska, Utah, and Nevada have under 160 museums. 4.3.2 Library map As we can see from the spatial graph, the state with higher number of library are clustered on the east side of the country especially the north east region while the state in the west east have relatively low number of libraries. 4.3.3 Relationship between museum and library distributions Based on the two graphs above, we can clearly tell there is strong correlation between the number of museums and of libraries, which indicates that both museums and libraries play similar roles in people’s daily life and can reflect some cultural development status of that area. We found north east and south west regions having more museums and libraries, which except indicating there might have more population, also reflecting that people in there regions seem to enjoy cultural life more. In addition, there exist some difference between museum and library distributions, states owing many libraries may have less museums, like Utah, on the contrary, states owing many museums may have less libraries, like North Dakota. We think it may be related to some specially local preferences.

Check state ranks of owing libraries or museums Library Museum "],["conclusion.html", "Chapter 6 Conclusion 6.1 Museum 6.2 Library", " Chapter 6 Conclusion 6.1 Museum 6.2 Library We have several conclusion after our analysis: California, New York, Ohio, Kansas, Texas are among those states with most well developed library system. They have a relatively high number of library in the state and relatively high amount of electronic or printed material in the libraries. The annual visitor of the libraries are also relatively high. This pattern is partly due to these states have more dense population and also the government attach importance on the development of library. Through the time series analysis, we found that the annual visitors of library are decreasing slowly during the past 15 years which probably due to the development of internet and people have more kinds of entertainment in the spare time. However, the sharp drop of the number of people visiting library in between 2019 and 2020 which is more likely due to the pandemic. Additionally, we can see the development and spread of ebook and other electronic resource in the past ten years as many the ebook resource in many states’ library increased quickly during the past years. Last but not least, by comparing the library data with museum data, we can see that states with well developed library also tend to have well developed museum. The north east region and California tend to have more library and museum related resources while the north west tend to have less. This is reasonable as library and museum are both important part of cultural development of a country or a region. Also there might be some history reason as some of the states have much longer history and are believed to be well developed region across the country and has higher population.
