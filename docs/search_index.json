Thus, there are libraries and museums across the nation aimed to serving people live in the region. Additionally, there are famous paintings, sculptures and other art works created by talented artist from all over the world preserving in some of museums in the country which becomes one of the must-visit scenic spots for travelers as well as the locals. As a result, libraries and museums are important components in the culture of a country and people’s life which makes it necessary and interesting to look into the data related to them. There are different kinds of museums such as museum of arts or museum for children and some museums are free to visit while some charging a ticket. For the public libraries, there are libraries with different scale and some provide more than just printed books. We are interested in the distribution of museums and libraries across the country including what kinds of museum are there and how many of museums or libraries across the country or in different states. Also, as both of them are part of the nation’s culture development, we are also curious about whether their distribution across the country has some similarity or clustering pattern. Moreover, with the development of technology, especially the use of cellphone and laptop which provides people a easy way to get new information, many people tend search on the internet when they are curious or eager to know something and people can read ebook on their cellphone or see the photo of the famous artworks instead of going to a library or museum for entertainment. We are also interested in how many people visit museum or library in their spare time in the new century. To sum up, we choose the topic about the museums and public libraries in US and would like to analyze the related data to explore in this topic. "],["proposal.html", "Chapter 2 Proposal 2.1 Research topic 2.2 Data availability", " Chapter 2 Proposal 2.1 Research topic Our research topic is about the museums and public libraries across the US. For the museums, there are different kinds of museums including art museums, history museums and so on. We are interested in the number of different kinds of museum countrywide and statewide. Also, different states have different number of museums which partly reflect the culture and development of individual states. Some of the museum are free to visit while some need to buy ticket, thus we would like to further analyze the income of individual museums. For the libraries, some libraries provide readers more than printed materials, such as audio and e-books and analyzing the number of books and other resources of a library can reflect the scale of the library. As many of libraries were built especially for the local resident and we would like to analyze relationship between the number of people visit the library or register in the library and the population of that area. Some of the libraries have librarian and we are also interested in their salary and also other aspect related to the economic condition of the library including their revenue. Also, to analyze the influence of modern technology, we would like to analyze the trend of the number of visitors of libraries. Moreover, as both the construction of museum and library are part of the culture development of a region, we will put data of library and museum together and explore whether their are some similarity between public library and museum in the same region which can reflect how much importance local government put on the culture development. In a word, our research focus on the number of museums and libraries across the nation as well as their scale and operation condition. By analyzing the distribution of the museums and libraries in different region, we try to analyze the local culture development. 2.2 Data availability The data used in this project are from the official website of the Institute of Museum and Library Services(IMLS): https://www.imls.gov/research-tools/data-collection . It contains information about location, discipline, revenues, etc. All datasets are in .csv format, which simplifies the data import process. The museum data are consisted of three datasets, and can be downloaded by link: https://www.imls.gov/sites/default/files/2018_csv_museum_data_files.zip . According to the Data File Documentation and User’s Guide for museum data on the website, the first release of these files is from 2013 to 2015 (FY 2014 Q1, FY 2015 Q1 and FY 2015 Q3, where “FY” stands for “Fiscal Year”, and “Q” stands for “Quarter”). The final cleaning and construction are from 2017-2018, which gives the newest (current) data version. Researchers of IMLS collected the data from multiple sources, for example, IMLS administrative records and lists of grantees from private foundations. The duplicate data during the collecting process were removed by combining statistical algorithms and manual entry review, guaranteeing data reliability. Each of the three files has the same data structure: one row per museum or related organization, with 50 column variables. During data import process, we will select the variables which are related to our research topic. For example, we can explore the distribution of museum over different locations by comparing AAMREG, BEAREG, LOCALE4 (geographical variables) with Museum Discipline. Then, we can obtain information about the number of museums in each state and the distribution of museum types among different states. We can also explore the relationship between museum income and types by comparing INCOMECD15 and Museum Discipline. The library data has been collected annually since 1988, but the electronic records are from 1992 to 2020. We will first use the most recent three datasets released in 2020: https://www.imls.gov/sites/default/files/2022-07/pls_fy2020_csv.zip . The data are collected using public libraries survey by recording the time, location, citizen satisfaction with library service, etc. To be more specific, surveys are distributed by data coordinators in each state, and then collected back from local public libraries. During the data import process, we will select the variables which demonstrate the number of visitors, amount of books, and revenue, of local libraries and then analyze the relationship between them. We will also analyze the development of libraries over time by using the relevant data from different years. To compare the similarity or differences between public libraries and museums in the same region, we will use these two datasets: https://www.imls.gov/sites/default/files/pnlms_pudf_csv.zip, which demonstrate the public needs for libraries and museums. The data were collected through a random-digit dialing telephone survey, which includes visitation to libraries and museums, attitudes toward library and museum services, and demographics. During the data import process, we will select the variables with the same geographical information as the above datasets because we want to compare the development of public libraries and museums in the same area by combining them with the previous datasets. Hence, these datasets provide sufficient information to analyze our research topic. "],["data.html", "Chapter 3 Data 3.1 Sources 3.2 Cleaning / transformation 3.3 Missing value analysis", " Chapter 3 Data 3.1 Sources 3.1.1 Library Data Source The library data set is also from https://www.imls.gov/ which is the website of the Institute of Museum and Library Service. This institute provide several data set regarding museum and library across the nation. We use the data set of The Public Libraries Survey (PLS) which supplied annually by public libraries across the country on when, where, and how library services are changing to meet the needs of the public. The data was collected by the institute. The survey is administered by Data Coordinators and the requested data was collected from local public libraries. There is a web-based reporting system State Data Coordinators used report data to the institute. The survey was conducted annually since 1988 and the website provides data files since 1992. During past years, the content on the survey changed 3 times and the format of the data sets are slightly differences. As for the data file, the data files are available on the web site and is a public-used data set which means some of the data was removed aimed to protect the confidentiality of individually identifiable survey respondents. Our project use this public-used data set which was encoded and pre-processed and provides a documentation file to help the user correctly understand the data set and gives detailed information about the data set. The data set provides statistics on the status of public libraries in the United States collected from approximately 9,000 public libraries with approximately 17,000 individual public library outlets in the 50 states, the District of Columbia, and outlying territories. The data set contains information about library visits, circulation, size of collections, public service hours, staffing, electronic resources, operating revenues and expenditures and number of service outlets. We basically use the state wide data which contains 55 rows and more than 100 variables. 3.2 Cleaning / transformation 3.2.1 Library Data Cleaning 3.3 Missing value analysis 3.3.1 Library Data We first visualize the missing data in our data set and discuss the pattern it has. This is an important step for us to under stand our data. #### Library Data Set 1. Library data of 2020 In this project, we first analyze the data of Library in US in 2020. According to the document of the data set, all the missing data is filled with ‘-1’. Thus, we will visualize the distribution of ‘-1’ in this data set. As we can see from the graph, the only row has missing data is the state with code ‘VI’ which is Virgin Islands. All other data is completed. As this state is an outlying area of the United States and missing data are primarily some statistic data about the revenue and resource data of the library, we believe it is reasonable to keep the data as ‘-1’ in these rows which have little effect on our visualization. This graph shows the pattern further which is most rows (data of different state) is complete and provide us a relatively good data quality to analyze and visualize the libraries in US. 3.3.1.1 Time series missing data analysis Moreover, to discuss the changing pattern of libraries in US, we collect library data in different years. Although we can easily read in all the raw data, band them together and select the variables we are interested in, we believe that to store such a large set of data makes the requirement of space of this project too big and the transforming progress takes a lot of time. As a result, we choose the variable in each years’ data and store them in a csv file. As the data update once a year, it will not take too much time to add new data to this file. As for the data format, we keep it same with the original data and all the missing data is filled with ‘-1’. As we can see from the graph, there are three states having missing data through the years which are GU(Guam), MP(Northern Mariana Islands) and VI(Virgin Islands). All of these states are outlying area of the United States. Thus, we keep these data with its original form. As we can see in this chart, among all the rows having missing data, some of them missing quite a lot of data while others only miss one or two data. As we result, we would like to further see the missing data. We select all the rows of the three states and data is as below: ## STABR YEAR POPU_LSA CENTLIB BRANLIB BKMOB BKVOL EBOOK VISITS ## 1 GU 2020 168678 1 5 0 286930 0 35115 ## 2 MP 2020 53883 1 2 1 83624 5500 44710 ## 3 VI 2020 106405 0 5 3 176762 -1 -1 ## 4 GU 2019 168678 1 5 0 278963 0 100095 ## 5 MP 2019 51433 1 2 1 82199 5000 147983 ## 6 VI 2019 106405 0 5 3 176762 -1 -1 ## 7 GU 2018 167358 1 5 0 276631 0 75119 ## 8 MP 2018 51994 1 2 1 92000 5000 126778 ## 9 VI 2018 106405 0 4 3 -1 -1 -1 ## 10 GU 2017 164229 1 5 0 272720 200 81572 ## 11 MP 2017 53883 1 2 0 92141 5000 104224 ## 12 GU 2016 159358 1 5 0 269270 200 71813 ## 13 GU 2015 159358 1 5 0 266695 200 72223 ## 14 GU 2014 159358 1 5 0 263486 1335 103593 ## 15 MP 2014 53883 1 1 0 -1 -1 -1 ## 16 VI 2014 106405 0 5 1 -1 -1 -1 ## 17 GU 2013 159358 1 5 1 260586 0 98969 ## 18 MP 2013 53883 1 1 0 -1 -1 -1 ## 19 VI 2013 106405 0 5 1 -1 -1 -1 ## 20 GU 2012 159358 1 5 1 258241 1278 75472 ## 21 MP 2012 53883 1 1 0 -1 -1 -1 ## 22 VI 2012 106405 0 5 1 -1 -1 -1 ## 23 GU 2011 159358 1 5 1 255277 0 80016 ## 24 MP 2011 53883 1 1 0 -1 -1 -1 ## 25 VI 2011 106405 0 5 1 -1 -1 -1 ## 26 GU 2010 180692 1 5 1 204503 0 84019 ## 27 MP 2010 53883 1 1 0 -1 -1 -1 ## 28 VI 2010 106405 0 5 1 -1 -1 -1 ## 29 GU 2009 175459 1 5 1 210079 0 60763 ## 30 MP 2009 -1 -1 -1 -1 -1 -1 -1 ## 31 VI 2009 -1 -1 -1 -1 -1 -1 -1 ## 32 GU 2008 25984 1 5 1 211772 -1 70061 ## 33 MP 2008 -1 -1 -1 -1 -1 -1 -1 ## 34 VI 2008 -1 -1 -1 -1 -1 -1 -1 ## 35 GU 2007 -1 -1 -1 -1 -1 -1 -1 ## 36 MP 2007 -1 -1 -1 -1 -1 -1 -1 ## 37 VI 2007 -1 -1 -1 -1 -1 -1 -1 ## 38 GU 2006 -1 -1 -1 -1 -1 -1 -1 ## 39 MP 2006 -1 -1 -1 -1 -1 -1 -1 ## 40 VI 2006 -1 -1 -1 -1 -1 -1 -1 From the table, we can see that in some year(2016,2015), two of the states didn’t report the data and among all the reported data, most of the missing data is in early years. As we would like to see the trend of the data, we also keep the original data in this data set in stead of filling them in some way.
